# Personal Health Metrics Analysis  

Independent data science project designing a longitudinal dataset to study relationships between activity, nutrition, and weight change.  
The project focuses on exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and early predictive modeling to identify behavioral patterns in personal health data.  

## Features  
- Custom panel dataset built for time-series health tracking  
- Data cleaning and transformation in Python and SQL  
- Exploratory visualizations and baseline predictive modeling  
- Reproducible workflows for continuous data collection  

## Tools & Technologies  
Python | SQL | Pandas | NumPy | scikit-learn | Matplotlib | Seaborn  

## Status  
Ongoing independent research (initiated July 2025). Next steps include refining data collection and developing supervised learning models for behavior prediction.
